# GroupMeTool

This tool processes a GroupMe group chat and computes metrics, including like counts, message counts, and the like to post ratio of each user.

You will need an Auth Token from GroupMe, which you can get by creating an Groupme Developer Account at https://dev.groupme.com/.

The only dependency required is the `requests` library.

This was originally written in `Python 2.7.10`, but has been upgraded to `Python 3.X.X`
